# Linux Server Automation and Monitoring Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to automate the setup, configuration, and monitoring of a Linux server environment on an AWS Ubuntu instance. The server hosts a web application using a LAMP/LEMP stack, implements basic security measures, and includes scripts for monitoring system performance.

## Prerequisites
- An AWS account with an Ubuntu EC2 instance.
- SSH access to your instance.
- Basic knowledge of Linux commands and scripting.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linux-server-automation.git
cd linux-server-automation
```

### 2. Run the Server Setup Script
The `setup_server.sh` script will update your server, install the LAMP/LEMP stack, and configure the firewall.

```bash
chmod +x setup_server.sh
./setup_server.sh
```

### 3. Configure Security and Monitoring
- **Fail2ban**: Protect your server from brute-force attacks by configuring Fail2ban. The configuration file is located in `etc/fail2ban/jail.local`.
- **Automatic Security Updates**: Ensure your system is up-to-date with `unattended-upgrades`.

### 4. Setup System Monitoring
The `monitor.sh` script monitors disk usage, memory, and CPU load, sending alerts if thresholds are exceeded.

```bash
chmod +x monitor.sh
./monitor.sh
```

### 5. Log Management
Configure log rotation using the provided `logrotate.conf` file.

```bash
sudo cp logrotate.conf /etc/logrotate.d/custom_logs
```

## Scripts and Automation

### setup_server.sh
This script automates the server setup, including package installation and firewall configuration.

### monitor.sh
This script monitors system performance and sends alerts if necessary.

### logrotate.conf
This configuration file manages log rotation to ensure your logs are properly archived.

## Monitoring and Security
- **Fail2ban**: Protects against brute-force attacks.
- **Unattended Upgrades**: Automatically installs security updates.
- **UFW**: Manages firewall rules.

## Networking
- **SSH Tunneling**: Secures web application access via SSH.
- **OpenVPN** (optional): Provides secure remote access to your server.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure your SSH key has the correct permissions (`chmod 400`).
- If your scripts don't run, check for execution permissions (`chmod +x`).
